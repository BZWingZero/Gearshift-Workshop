### Flow
The Mages of **Lienosea Landing** in **Gianmar** spent centuries honing their techniques in order to manipulate the tide and wind. The sailors departing from the city rewarded them for their efforts and the port grew prosperous. This careful study codified the domain of Flow and its ability to manipulate fluids including liquids and gasses.

Careful manipulation of air and water currents and even creating an area of a vaccuum allows skilled users to even cause other magic to be cancelled out, dispelling its effects. Some Mages used their techniques to keep blood flowing within an injured person's body and prevent infections from spreading.
