### Growth
**Thaven** is the heart of trade within **Goharan**'s fertile lands. Mages living in this lush flatland learned from the earth; what caused things to grow and to wither. They soon figured out how to manipulate &aelig;ther to increase crop yields and aid weary farmers.

Precise changes in the flow of time within all things allows masters to strengthen the brawn of their companions and help them withstand the grueling work in the fields. A few select Mages have even used their skill to speed the healing of injuries and help the body recover from disease by bolstering the immune system.
