The Scoundrel's business is subterfuge in all forms. If you need a fixer, swindler, or are running a complicated con the Scoundrel has the skills needed to pull it off. They have a way with words, able to talk their way into (or out of) anything and able to make others feel at ease around them without arousing suspicions.

The Scoundrel counts the following as career skills: **Charm**, **Cool**, **Coordination**, **Deception**, **Light Ranged**, **Skulduggery**, **Stealth**, and **Streetwise**.
