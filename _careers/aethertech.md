## &AElig;thertech
The &AElig;thertech sees the laws of physics as guidelines to be ignored when convenient. These eccentric fellows regularly see achieving the impossible as their goal. They tend to be researchers and inventors who regularly fuse the arcane with the mundane. However they can be myopic, focused more on their grand creations they do not always note the potential the consequences.

The &AElig;thertech counts the following as career skills: **&AElig;ther**, **Coercion**, **Mechanics**, **Medicine**, **Operating**, **Perception** , and **Skulduggery**.

The &AElig;thertech may also choose any one magic skill **Moderate**, **Fluid**, **Shock**, **Force**, or **Growth**, as a career skill.
