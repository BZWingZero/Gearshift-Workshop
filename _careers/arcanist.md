## Arcanist
The Arcanist is one of the few gifted with natural spellcasting abilities. Their abilities often manifest after a traumatic event early in their lives. They often live secluded lives and cloister together with other Arcanists to hone their craft. They were the ones who perfected the technique to crystallize the &aelig;ther from which they draw their powers.

The Arcanist counts the following as career skills: **&AElig;ther**, **Coercion**, **Discipline**, **Leadership**, **Lore**, **Skulduggery**, and **Vigilance**.

The Arcanist may also choose any one magic skill **Moderate**, **Flow**, **Shock**, **Force**, or **Growth**, as a career skill.
