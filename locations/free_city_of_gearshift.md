# The Free City of Gearshift

* **Government:** Brass Council
* **Language:** Common
* **Terrain:** Mountain Valley and caves
* **Exports:** Processed &AElig;ther
* **Imports:** Raw Materials
* **Points of Interest:**

The Free City of Gearshift is located at the headwaters of the Tasp River nestled in the foothills of the Pol mountains near the center of the continent. It is built into the mountain as well as covering a large portion of the nearby valley. Structures have been built up the sides of the mountain as well, to remain close to the &aelig;ther processing facilities.

### History
2200 years ago, a wellspring of &aelig;ther was discovered in a small cave near the Tasp River's headwaters. Some of the earliest &AElig;thertechs began investigating this unique source of magical energies. They partnered with a nearby dwarven settlement and worked with them to convert the cave into a research space. Soon after a town grew in the valley outside the cave and elaborate aqueducts were built to transport water to the fledgling settlement.

Over the millenia, the **Institute of Arcane Research** became a leader in &aelig;theric knowledge. Their study of the &aelig;ther wellspring led to the first method for condensing &aelig;ther into powder and then into &aelig;therite.

#### Brass Council

## Notes: 
* For centuries mages seculded themselves and only the wealthiest (kings, lords etc) could afford their services; which they used to secure their dynasties. Magic wasn't a part of daily life for most.
* A tense truce had been formed between the kingdoms and aside from minor flareups along borders, mostly stable.
* About 78 years ago, a master aethertech at the Institute of Arcane Research figured out how to condense raw aether as a fine powder (aether powder). This powder could then be compressed and heated forming heptagonal prisms of pure aetherite. The magic contained in the crystals was miniscule compared to the skill of trained mages. However, these aetherite crystals could be used by anyone.
* As the process for condensing the aetherpowder and making aetherite spread and the general public could get their hands on it, they began experimenting with it. This created a technological and industrial revolution with brilliant new minds using magic in ways the Mage orders never dreamed.
* The leaders of the nations became nervous as many had maintained their grip of power through Mages, and with the populace now gaining access to the once-restricted power their control was threatened.
