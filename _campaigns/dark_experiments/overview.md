Dark Experiments has three main sections:
**Synthesis**: A drug is being spread throughout the population. It boosts the power of a mage, but causes them to fall into a coma with repeated use. After enough mages use the drug, a very strong magical chimera beast forms from the excess &aelig;ther generated which can use magic from all five schools.

**Gestalt**: A bunch of growth mages are used to accelerate the computational power of another mage's brain to "overdrive" them in an attempt to create the strongest mage ever.

** Fusion**: A large number of growth mages are used to slow a sginle, powerful growth mage, Lilith Farrell, giving her an infinite amount of time to ponder and think and become the strongest mage ever. Will destroy her personality and humanity in the process through extreme isolation over (perceived) millenia.
