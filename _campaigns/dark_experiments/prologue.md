# Mysterious Bombings
## Dark Experiments 00 {#subtitle}

<i class="fa fa-map-marker fa-2x fa-fw"></i> The player characters start in a small park with buildings on three sides, and a street on the fourth. Along one side of the park a few food stalls are set up. A fountain is located in the middle of the park. About a dozen people of various ages are milling about. Stores line the far side of the street.

<i class="fa dice fa-2x fa-fw">s</i> One of the stores across the street explodes and two **Thugs** and a **Flame Mage** wearing masks run from the burning building. They are carrying a large bag and frequently look back over their shoulder.

If the players choose to engage the Thugs and Flame Mage, the **Guardian Corps.** will arrive as the battle ends. If the players choose not to engage the Thugs and Flame Mage, **Guardian Corps.** members should arrive almost immediately and begin to engage the targets. They will ask the players for their assistance protecting the civilians in the area as the players are the only ones who look capable.

If the Flame Mage is subdued before the thugs, a thug will attempt to take a nearby child hostage and negotiate for their freedom.

<i class="fa symbols fa-2x fa-fw">t</i> The Guardian Corps takes the adversaries into custody once they have been subdued. One of them, an Orc named Sangilak thanks the player characters for their assistance with the incident. Sangilak also discretely asks the player characters if they would meet the next day during the guard's regular patrol at **Station Square** about a potential job opportunity.

<!-- <i class="fa fa-map-marker fa-2x fa-fw"></i> The Sixth Street Arcade in District 5 is a wide boulevard that now houses a world-famous covered market. Stalls fill the archway-lined street and an intricate ironworks and glass ceiling protects the market below from the elements.  -->

Sangilak tells the group about a series of bombings which have been happening across the city. There haven't been many injuries among the public; quite a few Guardian Corps. members have become casualties while helping to clear civilians after a device is found. 

The **Guardian Corps.** has been spread thin investigating the rumors of a new drug that increases the potency of a user's magic that they haven't had the manpower to look into the bombings.
