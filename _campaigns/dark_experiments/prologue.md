# Mysterious Bombings

<i class="fa fa-map-marker fa-2x fa-fw"></i> The player characters start in a small park with buildings on three sides, and a street on the fourth. Along one side of the park a few food stalls are set up. A fountain is located in the middle of the park. About a dozen people of various ages are milling about. Stores line the far side of the street.

<i class="fa dice fa-2x fa-fw">s</i> One of the stores across the street explodes and two **Thugs** and a **Flame Mage** wearing masks run from the burning building. They are carrying a large bag and frequently look back over their shoulder.

If the players choose to engage the Thugs and Flame Mage, the **Guardian Corps.** will arrive as the battle ends. If the players choose not to engage the Thugs and Flame Mage, **Guardian Corps.** members should arrive almost immediately and begin to engage the targets. They will ask the players for their assistance protecting the civilians in the area as the players are the only ones who look capable.

If the Flame Mage is subdued before the thugs, a thug will attempt to take a nearby child hostage and negotiate for their freedom.

<i class="fa symbols fa-2x fa-fw">t</i> The Guardian Corps takes the adversaries into custody once they have been subdued. One of them thanks the player characters for their assistance with the incident. The guard also discretely asks the player characters if they would meet later at the **Sixth Street Arcade** about a potential job opportunity.
