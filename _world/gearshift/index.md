The Free City of Gearshift is located at the headwaters of the Tasp River nestled in the foothills of the Pol mountains near the center of the continent. It is built into the mountain as well as covering a large portion of the nearby valley. Structures have been built up the sides of the mountain as well, to remain close to the &aelig;ther processing facilities.

#### History
2200 years ago, a wellspring of &aelig;ther was discovered in a small cave near the Tasp River's headwaters. Some of the earliest &AElig;thertechs began investigating this unique source of magical energies. They partnered with a nearby dwarven settlement and worked with them to convert the cave into a research space. Soon after a town grew in the valley outside the cave and elaborate aqueducts were built to transport water to the fledgling settlement.

Over the millenia, the **Institute of Arcane Research** became a leader in &aelig;theric knowledge. Their study of the &aelig;ther wellspring led to the first method for condensing &aelig;ther into powder and then into &aelig;therite.
